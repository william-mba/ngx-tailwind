### Motivation

The aim of this project is to provide to Angular Developers a set of beautiful, fast and reliable UI components based on Tailwind CSS as Tailwind UI does for React and Vue.

### Features

- **High quality**: Thoughtfully-crafted and well tested to ensure performance and reliability.
- **Versatile**: Ready to use and fully customizable components to rapidly build great UIs easier than ever.
- **Frictionless**: Super easy to use and integrate to your existing Angular projects.

### Installation

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
