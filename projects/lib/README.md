### Why This Project?

A few months ago, I wanted to use **Tailwind CSS components** in my Angular project. However, at the time, the Tailwind UI documentation only offered components for React, Vue, and pure HTML templates.  

The need of beautiful, fast and reliabale UI components based on Taiwind CSS inspired me to create this library.  

I’ve dedicated a significant amount of time to **carefully crafting each component** so that you don’t have to. My goal was to make this library **simple to use, highly customizable, and easily extendable**, enabling you to stay productive and focused while building exceptional UIs—without needing advanced design skills.  

While there’s still a long way to go with more components to implement, I encourage you to try the existing ones and share your thoughts. Your **feedback is invaluable**, and I’d love to hear how NGXTW fits into your needs and how it could be improved.  

I hope you enjoy using NGXTW as much as I enjoyed creating it. Together, we can make this library even better—your contributions, in any form, are always welcome!
