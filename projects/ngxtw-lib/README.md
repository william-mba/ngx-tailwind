### Motivation

The goal of this project is to provide a set of beautiful, fast and reliable Angular components based on Tailwind CSS as the Tailwind team does for React and Vue.

### Challenge

After looking at existing Angular libraries using Tailwind, you will agree with me that NGXTW is the best way to quickly integrate Tailwind CSS components with Angular. From simple buttons to complex components that are ease to use and customize, NGXTW provides a wide range of production-ready UI components to help you build your application even faster.

### Why NGxTW?

- **High-quality**:
  - Beautiful and consistent design.
  - Fully tested to ensure performance and reliability.
  - Light and dark mode support out of the box.
- **Lightweight and fast**:
    - No external dependencies.
    - Use only Tailwind CSS for animations.
    - Standalone and tree-shakable components by default.
- **Fully customizable**:
  - Dependency injection based configuration.
  - Support for customs class names from the HTML class attribute.
  - Built with Tailwind CSS but can be use with any utility-first CSS framework.
